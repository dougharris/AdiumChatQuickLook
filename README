This is a [quicklook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Look) viewer for chat logs produced by [Adium](http://www.adium.im). To use:

1. Fork the git repo (or download the source file)
2. Build the project in xcode
3. Create $HOME/Library/QuickLook
4. Copy AdiumChatQuickLook.qlgenerator to ~/Library/QuickLook
5. At a command line, type "qlmanage -r" and hit return.

Now when you find an Adium chat log file in Finder (by browsing or via spotlight), you can hit the spacebar and preview up to the first 50 lines of the chat.
